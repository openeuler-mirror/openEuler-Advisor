    |Can I Use Python 3?| |Say Thanks!|\n\n`olefile <https://www.decalage.info/olefile>`__
    is a Python package to\nparse, read and write `Microsoft OLE2\nfiles <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_File_Binary_Format>`__\n(also
    called Structured Storage, Compound File Binary Format or Compound\nDocument File
    Format), such as Microsoft Office 97-2003 documents,\nvbaProject.bin in MS Office
    2007+ files, Image Composer and FlashPix\nfiles, Outlook messages, StickyNotes,
    several Microscopy file formats,\nMcAfee antivirus quarantine files, etc.\n\n**Quick

    all updates and news on Twitter: https://twitter.com/decalage2\n\n-  **2018-09-09
    v0.46**: OleFileIO can now be used as a context manager\n   (with...as), to close
    the file automatically (see\n   `doc <https://olefile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Howto.html#open-an-ole-file-from-disk>`__).\n   Improved
    handling of malformed files, fixed several bugs.\n-  2018-01-24 v0.45: olefile
    can now overwrite streams of any size,\n   improved handling of malformed files,
    fixed several\n   `bugs <https://github.com/decalage2/olefile/milestone/4?closed=1>`__,\n   end
    of support for Python 2.6 and 3.3.\n-  2017-01-06 v0.44: several bugfixes, removed
    support for Python 2.5\n   (olefile2), added support for incomplete streams and
    incorrect\n   directory entries (to read malformed documents), added getclsid,\n   improved
    `documentation <http://olefile.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`__\n   with API reference.\n-  2017-01-04:
    moved the documentation to\n   `ReadTheDocs <http://olefile.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`__\n-  2016-05-20:
    moved olefile repository to\n   `GitHub <https://github.com/decalage2/olefile>`__\n-  2016-02-02
    v0.43: fixed issues\n   `#26 <https://github.com/decalage2/olefile/issues/26>`__
    and\n   `#27 <https://github.com/decalage2/olefile/issues/27>`__, better\n   handling
    of malformed files, use python logging.\n-  see\n   `changelog <https://github.com/decalage2/olefile/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`__\n   for
    more detailed information and the latest changes.\n\nDownload/Install\n----------------\n\nIf
    you have pip or setuptools installed (pip is included in Python\n2.7.9+), you
    may simply run **pip install olefile** or **easy_install\nolefile** for the first
    installation.\n\nTo update olefile, run **pip install -U olefile**.\n\nOtherwise,
    see http://olefile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install.html\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n-  Parse,
    read and write any OLE file such as Microsoft Office 97-2003\n   legacy document
    formats (Word .doc, Excel .xls, PowerPoint .ppt,\n   Visio .vsd, Project .mpp),
    Image Composer and FlashPix files, Outlook\n   messages, StickyNotes, Zeiss AxioVision
    ZVI files, Olympus FluoView\n   OIB files, etc\n-  List all the streams and storages
    contained in an OLE file\n-  Open streams as files\n-  Parse and read property
    streams, containing metadata of the file\n-  Portable, pure Python module, no
    dependency\n\nolefile can be used as an independent package or with PIL/Pillow.\n\nolefile
    is mostly meant for developers. If you are looking for tools to\nanalyze OLE files
    or to extract data (especially for security purposes\nsuch as malware analysis
    and forensics), then please also check my\n`python-oletools <https://www.decalage.info/python/oletools>`__,
    which\nare built upon olefile and provide a higher-level interface.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nPlease
    see the `online\ndocumentation <http://olefile.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`__ for
    more\ninformation.\n\nReal-life examples\n------------------\n\nA real-life example:
    `using OleFileIO_PL for malware analysis and\nforensics <http://blog.gregback.net/2011/03/using-remnux-for-forensic-puzzle-6/>`__.\n\nSee
    also `this\npaper <https://computer-forensics.sans.org/community/papers/gcfa/grow-forensic-tools-taxonomy-python-libraries-helpful-forensic-analysis_6879>`__\nabout
    python tools for forensics, which features olefile.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nolefile
